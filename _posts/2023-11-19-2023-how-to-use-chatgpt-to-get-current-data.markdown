Is ChatGPT truly limited in finding current Black Friday deals? In a recent Mashable article by Christina Buff titled ["Dont bother using ChatGPT to find Black Friday deals this season - here's why"](mashable-article), she asserts that ChatGPT is unable to find Black Friday deals because of its inability for "real-time internet access". While her perspective on ChatGPT is not uncommon, the recent updates to ChatGPT and integration with Bing now allow ChatGPT to surf the internet in real time. However, this couldnt be more false with the recent updates to ChatGPT 4, the rollout of ChatGPT wth Bing, or some creative ingenuity with ChatGPT 3.5 and let here's why.

## ChatGPT 4

ChatGPT 4 CAN surf the web in real-time, but the real problem lies in her prompt. Even if she was using ChatGPT 4, her poor prompt does her little favors in trying to get the information she wants. I find it best to take an iterative approach to constructing a prompt where you open a dialog with ChatGPT and have a conversation to reach the best result.

### Prompt Comparison

To compare, I engineered a prompt similar to how I use ChatGPT 4 everyday. Let's take a look at her prompt versus my prompt.

Her prompt: "What robot vacuums will go on sale for Black Friday?"

My prompt: "Please search the web for robot vacuums that will go on sale for Black Friday. I want a detailed report on each vacuum. I want the list ordered by price from lowest to highest. If the price is the same, please organize by rating from highest to lowest.

Her prompt just scratches the surface on what is possible whith ChatGPT. She should probably further clarify in her prompt what specific details are important to her. She should additional specify how ChatGPT formats the results. I also find it helpful to provide ChatGPT with as much context about your use case as possible. If availabble, she can use 'Custom Instructions' to provide detailed background information for ChatGPT to reference.

This would significantly improve her prompt and probably cut out a lot of the leg work she is normally required to do. Of course, I only dipped a toe into what ChatGPT can do and if you would like more information on prompting, please send me an email.

### Side note

Before we continue, it is important to note that she is probably using ChatGPT 3.5 and not 4. I came to this conclusion based on the responses she was getting to her questions. This might be for various reasons, but is really besides the point.

### Response Comparison

Our ChatGPT versions and prompts are different so it's no surprise our responses are dramatically different. To try and include a control prompt/response, I asked ChatGPT 4, Christina's exact question, word for word. Now let's compare the responses:

Christina ChatGPT: "I'm sorry, but I don't have real-time information, including details on specific Black Friday deals or sales for robot vacuums in 2023..." and it continues on with possible work arounds.

ChatGPT 4 response: "I have found some Black Friday deals for robot vacuums, although I was unable to complete a comprehensive list ordered by price and rating as per your request. Here's the information I gathered:

## ChatGPT with Bing

I understand that paying for ChatGPT 4 is not for everyone. That's okay because you can still take advantage of surfing the web in real-time with ChatGPT by opening a Microsoft Edge browser and using Bing Chat with GPT-4. I asked Bing Chat Christina's question word for word and here is the response I received:

Bing Chat response: "I found some robot vacuums that will be on sale for Black Friday. Here are some of the deals I found:

1. [**Shark ION Robot Vacuum**](bing-search): Priced at **$149.00** from QVC.
2. [**Samsung Jet Bot+ Robot Vacuum**](bing-search): Priced at **$599.99** (original price: $799.99) from Best Buy.
3. [**Roborock S7 Robot Vacuum**](bing-search): Priced at **$359.99** (original price: $649.99) from Roborock.
4. [**Bobsweep Pro Robot Vacuum**](bing-search): Priced at **$269.99** from Target.

10. [**iRobot Roomba i1 (1154) Wi-Fi Connected Robot Vacuum**](blackfriday): Priced at **$189.98** from Sam's Club.

Please note that these deals are subject to change and may vary by location. I hope this helps!"

## CTRL + c, CTRL + v, ChatGPT 3

This final method is for anyone who doesnt want to or doesnt have access to the previously mentioned methods. ChatGPT 3.5 might not be able to surf the web in real time, but YOU can! Search in your favorite web browser "robot vacuum black friday deals 2023" or whatever it is you're searching for, then provide the search results to ChatGPT 3.5 to analyze and query your results.

You might need to truncate your search results and provide them in chunks. ChatGPT 3.5 has a limit to how long a question can be. Therefore, if your search results goes beyond that limit, you can break your esults up into smaller chunks and ask ChatGPT 3.5 to analyze each chunk. I had to break my search results up into 2 chunks to fit within the limit.

## Conclusion

It is clear that ChatGPT can surf the web in real time to find deals for Black Friday. And in additiona to surfing the web, can also provide detailed analysis and user friendly formatted data all in a single prompt. I have outlined three different methods that can accomplish this, by using ChatGPT 4 which comes with the ability to surf the web in real time, by using Bing Chat which uses ChatGPT 4 and can surf the web in real time, and by using ChatGPT 3.5 and providing GPT with real time web browsing results.
